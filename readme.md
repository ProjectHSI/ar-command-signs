Command Signs
=======
-------------
Description :
-------------
This fork was created for the Cairns Minecraft Server, because the original repo for which that this repo was forked off of, did not provide seperation for *Super* and *OP* commands.


How this was made :
-------------------
This was made using permission checking upon every client request to change the *Command Sign*'s command properties,
although **ONLY** checks them if the command starts with '*#*' or '*^*'.

Commands :
----------
To view commands. Do

    /commandsigns help
